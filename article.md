Can data-driven models for weather and climate predictions learn the underlying physics of the system against which they are trained? Or are they simply capable of identifying statistical patterns without any clear link to the underlying physics? {cite:t}`furner_2022` run a sensitivity analysis of a regression-based ocean temperature model, trained against simulations from a 3D ocean model setup, demostrating that regression models are capable of learning much of the physics of the underlying system.

## Dataset

The training and validation data derive from running the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model ([MITgcm](https://zenodo.org/record/4672260#.ZFgb_S-B2pY)) —a physically based model capable of simulating the ocean or the atmosphere dynamics due to isomorphisms in the governing equations. This research project relies on a simple 2° sector configuration that captures the fundamental dynamics of the ocean, including a realistic overturning circulation. This configuration features a single ocean basin, with:
+ limited topography
+ simplified coastlines 
+ constant idealized forcing 

The domain runs from 60°S to 60° N, and is just over 20° wide in longitude. The domain is bounded by land along its northern and southern edges, and a strip of land runs along the eastern/western boundary from 60° N to 40° S.  Below this, in the southernmost 20°, the simulator has a periodic boundary condition, allowing flow that exits to the east and west to return to the domain at the western and eastern boundary. The domain has flat-bottom bathymetry of 5,000 m over most of the domain, with a 2° region of 2,500-m depth at the southernmost 20° of the eastern edge.

The simulator has:
+ 42 depth levels, with the surface layer being the thinnest at 10 m, and the bottom 10 levels being the maximum at 250 m. + 11 cells in the longitudinal direction
+ 78 cells in the latitudinal direction

The simulator has a 12-hr time step, with fields output daily. We focus on daily-mean outputs.

## Results

### Ocean dynamics ([Figure %s](#fig-1))

The paper uses a  2° sector configuration to simulate ocean dynamics. This configuration features a single ocean basin, with limited topography, simplified coastlines, and constant idealized forcing. This has been used in a number of idealized simulations of Southern Ocean processes and their impacts on the global circulation. This configuration, while relatively simple, captures the fundamental dynamics of the ocean, including a realistic overturning circulation.

In the following script, we load the MITGCM DATASET and visualize the configuration used to simulate the ocean dynamics. Focusing particuarly on:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Temperature (°C) at 25 m below the surface for one particular day.</li>
<li>Change in temperature between over 1 day at 25 m below the surface.</li>
<li>Standard deviation in temperature at 25 m below the surface.</li>
<li>Temperature (°C) at 25 m below the surface and 13° E for one particular day.</li>
<li>Change in temperature between over 1 day in temperature at 25 m below the surface & 13° E.</li>
<li>Standard deviation in temperature at 25 m below the surface & 13° E.</li>
<li>Time series at 57° N, 17° E, and −25 m.</li>
<li>Time series at 55° S, 9° E, and −25 m.</li>

Notice that the domain:
+ runs from  60°𝑆 to  60°𝑁, and is just over  20° wide in longitude. 
+ is bounded by land along the northern (and southern) edge, and a strip of land runs along the eastern (and western) boundary from 60°.
  N to  40°𝑆 (see Figure 1a). Below this, in the southernmost 20°, the simulator has a periodic boundary condition, allowing flow that exits to the east (west) to return to the domain at the western (eastern) boundary. 
+ has flat-bottom bathymetry of 5,000 m over most of the domain, with a 2° region of 2,500-m depth at the southernmost 20° of the eastern edge (i.e., the spit of land forming the eastern boundary continues to the southern boundary as a 2,500-m high subsurface ridge).

Importantly, note from the figures presented, that the depth axis is scaled to give each GCM grid cell equal spacing. The simulator shows a realistic temperature distribution with warm surface water near the equator, and cooler water near the poles and in the deep ocean. Temperature changes are largest in the very north of the domain and throughout the southern region. Though changes per day are small, they accumulate over time to give cycles of around 0.2° in some regions of the domain.

### Performance of the regressor

#### Scatter plot for the control regressor ([Figure %s](#fig-2)) - Different from above

The model captures the central part of the distribution well. While the majority of the temperature change is dominated by small near-zero changes, capturing these is key to producing a good forecast system. To a lesser extent, the regressor also captures the tails of the distribution, where temperature changes are larger, although the underprediction is more significant here. However, it is noteworthy that the model still shows some skill for these points, given that the model used is very simple and there are a relatively limited number of training samples in the tails.

#### Spatial patterns of errors ([Figure %s](#fig-3))

The regressor shows the largest errors are located in the north of the domain and in the Southern Ocean. We see that the errors in the north of the domain are co-located with regions of high vertical advective temperature fluxes, and regions of high convective fluxes. These results imply the regression model struggles to fully capture the vertical processes, and the associated heat flux, in the north of the domain. The high errors in the Southern Ocean are again co-located with regions of high vertical diffusive fluxes, this time both explicit and implicit, and vertical advection.  Throughout the ocean interior where temperature changes and the fluxes associated with these are small, errors are also small as would be expected.

### Sensitivity analysis

#### Coefficient analysis ([Figure %s](#fig-4))

High-weighted inputs (those with a large magnitude coefficient) are variables which are heavily used in the predictions and therefore considered important for the predictive skill. From the above figures we infer: 

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>From Figure 4a: Density (as a linear term, not in combination with other variables) is by far the most highly weighted variable in this model. This agrees well with the current physical understanding of ocean dynamics.</li>
<li>From Figure 4a: The location information is low weighted, particularly when interacting with other variables. This indicates that the regressor is not basing its predictions predominantly on the location of points, but on the physical variables themselves.</li>
<li>From Figure 4b: Multiplicative interaction between temperatures at the grid point we are predicting for and the temperature at all surrounding points is very highly weighted. This fits well with our physical expectation of the system—as diffusive and advective fluxes of temperature are dominated by local gradients in temperature.</li>
</ol>

#### Witholding experiments
In this section, we run a series of withholding experiments. For each of the variables described with the exception of temperature, we train a new regressor leaving out that one variable group, for example, we train a new regressor with all the existing inputs except for salinity at all surrounding points and any multiplicative terms including salinity.

##### Withholding multiplicative terms: ([Figure %s](#fig-5)); Importance of Non-Linearity

We see that, without multiplicative terms, the model can capture the mean behavior of the system (zero change in temperature) but is unable to capture any of the variability. This mean behavior alone does not provide useful forecasts, as can be seen from the statistics for this experiment. Nonlinearity is shown to be critical to modeling the variability of temperature change.

##### Withholding 3D structure: ([Figure %s](#fig-6)); Impact of vertical structure

The horizontal (U and V) components of the currents directly drive horizontal advection of temperature. They are also indirectly related to horizontal diffusion, as this is increased in regions of high currents and steep gradients. As such, we would expect that suppressing information about the horizontal currents would cause increases in error in regions where horizontal advection and horizontal diffusion is high. However, again, we note that this region of increased error is one where many processes are present, and the increased errors seen also coincide, to a lesser extent, with regions of high vertical processes (advection, diffusion, and convection), which is less in line with our physical understanding. Here, errors appear more closely matched to the horizontal processes, and so a reasonable interpretation is that the model here is behaving as expected.

## Conclusions

* There has been much recent interest in developing data-driven models for weather and climate predictions. However, there are open questions regarding their generalizability and robustness, highlighting a need to better understand how they make their predictions. In particular, it is important to understand whether data-driven models learn the underlying physics of the system against which they are trained, or simply identify statistical patterns without any clear link to the underlying physics. 
* In this notebook, we run a sensitivity analysis of a regression-based model of ocean temperature, trained against simulations from a 3D ocean model setup in a very simple configuration. 
* We show that the regressor heavily bases its forecasts on, and is dependent on, variables known to be key to the physics such as currents and density. By contrast, the regressor does not make heavy use of inputs such as location, which have limited direct physical impacts. 
* The model requires nonlinear interactions between inputs in order to show any meaningful skill—in line with the highly nonlinear dynamics of the ocean. Further analysis interprets the ways certain variables are used by the regression model. 
* We see that information about the vertical profile of the water column reduces errors in regions of convective activity, and information about the currents reduces errors in regions dominated by advective processes. 
* Our results demonstrate that even a simple regression model is capable of learning much of the physics of the system being modeled. We expect that a similar sensitivity analysis could be usefully applied to more complex ocean configurations.
